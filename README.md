# Chat Application

## Overview
A simple realtime chat applicaton, allows users to register, log in, and exchange messages seamlessley in a public server. Built with Express.js, Vue.js, Prisma ORM, and MySQL. 
This project is inspired by <a href="chat.ponkis.xyz">chat.ponkis.xyz</a>, I took the opportunity to develop a similar one from scratch for learning about implementing chat features for web development.

## Features
-  <strong>User authentication</strong>: Cookie based JWT token login and registration system.
-  <strong>Realtime messaging</strong>: Implemented websocket with socket.io library for realtime message updates.
-  <strong>Posting</strong>: User can share their thoughts on their timeline.
-  <strong>Profile Customization</strong>: User can edit their profile picture, username, and other information.
